# Skill: Vulnerability Disclosure

> Time-bounded, principled approach to disclosing vulnerabilities, derived from Project Zero's 90+30 policy.

## When to Use

- You've found a security vulnerability
- You need to report to a vendor
- You're establishing disclosure timelines
- You're deciding when/how to publish details
- You're handling vendor communication

## Prerequisites

- Confirmed vulnerability (reproducible)
- Root cause understood
- Impact assessed
- Contact information for vendor security team

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Report
```
□ Clear title describing the vulnerability
□ Affected product/version
□ Vulnerability type/class
□ Step-by-step reproduction
□ Root cause explanation
□ Impact assessment (CVSS or narrative)
□ Suggested fix (if known)
□ Proof of concept (minimal, responsible)
□ Your contact information
□ Disclosure timeline expectations
```

### 2. Identify the Right Contact
```
□ Check for security.txt file
□ Look for security@vendor.com
□ Check vendor's security policy page
□ Use coordinated disclosure platforms (HackerOne, Bugcrowd)
□ Last resort: public security contact
```

### 3. Send Initial Report
```
□ Use encrypted communication if possible (PGP)
□ Mark as confidential
□ State your disclosure timeline clearly
□ Request acknowledgment within 7 days
□ Keep records of all communication
```

### 4. Track Timeline (90+30 Model)
```
Day 0:   Report sent to vendor
Day 7:   Expect acknowledgment (follow up if none)
Day 14:  Expect initial assessment from vendor
Day 30:  Check-in on fix progress
Day 60:  Check-in, assess if extension needed
Day 90:  DEADLINE - Patch should be available
Day 120: Technical details can be published (if patch released)
```

### 5. Handle Vendor Communication
```
□ Respond promptly to questions
□ Provide additional details as needed
□ Negotiate timeline adjustments if justified
□ Document all agreements in writing
□ Maintain professional tone
```

### 6. Evaluate Extension Requests
```
GRANT extension if:
  - Vendor is actively working on fix
  - Fix is complex and nearly complete
  - Extension is reasonable (14-30 days)
  - Vendor communicates proactively

DENY extension if:
  - No evidence of active work
  - Repeated delays without progress
  - Vulnerability is being actively exploited
  - Vendor is unresponsive
```

### 7. Publish (Post-Patch)
```
□ Confirm patch is available to users
□ Wait grace period (30 days from patch)
□ Publish technical writeup
□ Credit vendor appropriately
□ Link to patch/advisory
□ Include lessons learned
```

### 8. Handle Active Exploitation
```
IF vulnerability is being actively exploited:
  □ Accelerate timeline (7-day deadline)
  □ Notify vendor immediately of exploitation
  □ Consider partial disclosure to enable defense
  □ Coordinate with CERT/CC if needed
```

```
Subject: Security vulnerability in ProductX authentication

Dear Security Team,

I've discovered a vulnerability in ProductX that allows 
authentication bypass. Details attached (PGP encrypted).

I follow a 90-day disclosure policy. This report was sent 
on [DATE], making the disclosure deadline [DATE + 90].

Please acknowledge receipt within 7 days.

[Contact details]
```

### Good: Justified Extension
```
Vendor: "We need 2 more weeks - the fix requires a 
database migration and we're at 85% complete."

Response: "Understood. Given the active progress, I'll 
extend the deadline by 14 days to [NEW DATE]. Please 
confirm this works for your release schedule."
```

## Anti-patterns

### ❌ No Timeline
```
DON'T: Report without stating disclosure expectations
WHY: Vendors may deprioritize indefinitely
```

### ❌ Immediate Full Disclosure
```
DON'T: Publish details without giving vendor time to fix
WHY: Users can't protect themselves, harms ecosystem
```

### ❌ Indefinite Embargo
```
DON'T: Let vendors delay forever with repeated extensions
WHY: Users remain at risk, no accountability
```

### ❌ Adversarial Tone
```
DON'T: Threaten, demand, or be hostile
WHY: Damages relationship, slows fix
```

### ❌ Incomplete Reports
```
DON'T: Send vague reports without reproduction steps
WHY: Delays triage, wastes everyone's time
```
